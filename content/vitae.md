## Project Experience
1. Exploratory methods in development work using EPIC-InterAct
data, HKUST. 2017.07-2019.03
 - Involved in developing statistical methods to deal with covariate measured with error under logistic regression model and Cox regression model based on EPICInterAct data, especially for covariates have relative large measurement error, for
example, FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) data in nutrition.
 - Performance: We have derived moment method and approximation maximumlikelihood method to deal with covariates measured with error under logistic regression and Cox regression. Simulation results are as expected. Compared to naive and regression calibration methods, real data analysis from our methods
are more reasonable.

1. Statistical modelling of growth and development in assessing the determinants of pubertal timing and growth, Cooperation project between HKUST and School of Public Health, the University of Hong Kong. 2016.01-2017.11
 - Involved in building statistical models to analyze determinants of pubertal timing and growth based on "Children in 1997" data. Especially in developing methods to compute individual age at peak velocity (apv), peak velocity (pv) and height at peak velocity (ypv), since pv and apv are useful and objective markers for respectively the velocity and timing of puberty for both boys and girls.
 - Performance: Based on the SITAR model, we proposed the numerical method and the quadratic function method to calculate apv, pv and ypv. Our paper has been published on Journal–Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine. In addition, corresponding R package– [iapvbs](https://github.com/Zhiqiangcao/iapvbs)
has also been created by us.

1. Analysis of an ongoing large study on diabetes, School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong. 2016.10-2017.04
 - Based on more than 600 thousands sample data of Hong Kong, taking part in building survival model to analyze relationship between mortality of Diabetes and related factors.
 - Performance: According to cross-validation, our proposed model performes better than the Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) model conducted by the Hong Kong Diabetes Registry, and the C-statistics of our model is larger. What's more, we found some new significant factors, which were not included in the
JADE model.
